# *Single Switch Network*

## *Project Overview*

*Single Switch Network* is a basic network topology created using **Cisco Packet Tracer**. The project consists of a single switch connected to *12 PCs* and *12 laptops*, simulating a local area network (*LAN*) environment. It is ideal for beginners to understand switch-based networking, device connectivity, and basic IP addressing.

## *Network Topology*

- **1 x Cisco 2960 Switch**
- **12 x PCs**
- **12 x Laptops**
- **Connections:** Each device is connected to the switch using a *Copper Straight-Through* cable.

## *IP Addressing Scheme*
- **PCs & Laptops:** Assigned sequentially from `160.160.0.1` to `160.160.0.24`
- **Subnet Mask:** `255.255.255.0`
